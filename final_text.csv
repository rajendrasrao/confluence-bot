6,Get the most out of your software project space,"Define your requirementsConfluence is the perfect place to start defining your requirements.

All the information you need is right there.Manage your sprintsThere's often a lot of material in Confluence that provides useful context for your team during a sprint. These might be requirements documents, designs, tech specs, customer research and more. By linking these pages to epics, you make them easy for your team to find during the sprint.Here's how you can use Confluence to support your sprint from within Jira Agile:In Jira, create a Confluence page to plan your sprint. The page is created using the Meeting notes template and is automatically linked to the sprint.In an epic, link to useful Confluence pages, including requirements, designs, and more.Report on your progress to stakeholders using the Jira Report blueprint in Confluence.Use the Retrospective template in Confluence at the end of your sprint to take stock of what went well and not so well.For people who work mostly in Jira, the integration means that useful Confluence pages are only a click away.Your team doesn't work in a silo, so it's important to make it easy for anyone to find work you're currently working on.Use shortcuts to keep information accessibleNext time someone asks for a status update, direct them to your space. Confluence makes it easy to give other teams a window into your world.The space shortcuts highlighted below can be critical to navigation for both your team and your entire organization. Add team's roadmap, quarterly goals, meeting notes, important files, and decisions for easy access.

7,Baby John,"Story:story:A former cop leads a double life to protect his daughter from an old enemy. When his identity is compromised, he must ensure his little girl’s safety while taking the nemesis down.Review: Bakery owner John D’Silva (Varun Dhawan) is a loving single dad to Khushi (Zara Zyanna). When her teacher, Tara (Wamiqa Gabbi), saves a young girl from being trafficked and takes her to the police station in John’s van, she unwittingly unravels John’s past as a fearless cop, DCP Satya Verma. His real identity exposed, John must confront his nemesis, a dreaded criminal Nana (Jackie Shroff), who seeks revenge for his son’s death. As Khushi’s life is put in danger, John is forced to step back into his past to protect her.John and Khushi's endearing bond sets the tone for the movie, with lighthearted moments featuring Tara. However, the promising narrative turns uneven when delving into the flashback of John's life as a supercop. Atlee, Sumit Arora and Kalees's story sticks to a tried-and-tested formula, with familiar tropes like kidnappers exploiting children and a hero rising against crime. Even Satya’s romance with a doctor, Meera (Keerthy Suresh), feels formulaic. The story gains steam once Nana’s son abducts a young girl and Satya brings him to justice.Throughout its runtime of two hours and forty-one minutes, the tracks of John's past and present-day struggles don't always feel cohesive, affecting the movie's overall engagement.That said, the film has offers entertaining moments, including playful self-references like Satya asking a goon about the fastest animal, to which the response is, “Bhediya, aapko toh pata hoga,” a nod to Varun’s horror-comedy. As an action entertainer, the stunt choreography offers some exciting sequences, as Kiran Koushik’s cinematography adds flair with pyrotechnics and sleek camera angles.Varun Dhawan impresses, balancing a dual role as a caring father and a fearless cop. His performance adds depth and conviction to the otherwise predictable narrative. Wamiqa Gabbi impresses with her screen presence, though her character’s background as an undercover cop remains unexplored. Rajpal Yadav as constable Sevakram and Jacky, John’s trusted aide, is a delightful surprise, offering more than just comic relief. Jackie Shroff’s menacing Nana leaves a lasting impression, making the most of his screen time.The movie has its moments as an actioner, but in terms of content and narrative, it could have more impactful.",https://raorsingh.atlassian.net/wiki/rest/api/content/98538
8,Manu Bhaker breaks silence on Khel Ratna snub: Awards not my goal,"Indian shooter Manu Bhaker has addressed the controversy surrounding her exclusion from the nominees for the prestigious Major Dhyan Chand Khel Ratna award. The Paris Olympics medallist clarified her stance in a statement, emphasising that while awards are motivational, they are not her ultimate goal.""As an athlete, my role is to play and perform for my country,"" Bhaker said. She added that awards and recognition inspire her but do not define her journey. Bhaker acknowledged a potential lapse in her nomination process and assured that efforts are being made to address the issue.The Sports Ministry reportedly stated that Bhaker did not apply for the award, but her father, Ram Kishan, contested this claim, asserting that the nomination was submitted, and no response was received.Despite the controversy, Bhaker remains focused on her performance. ""Irrespective of the award, I shall remain motivated to win more medals for my country,"" she said, urging people to avoid speculation about the matter.The 12-member National Sports Day committee, led by retired Supreme Court judge Justice V Ramasubramanian, did not include Bhaker in the list of nominees. Among those nominated were Indian men's hockey team captain Harmanpreet Singh and para-athlete Praveen Kumar.Bhaker's statement reflects her determination to prioritise her sporting career over external recognition. Her focus remains steadfast on representing India and achieving success on the global stage.Speaking to India Today, Ram Kishan said, ""What's the point of getting two medals in a single Olympics if you have to beg for awards?""""One government official is deciding, and committee members are silent, not giving their opinion. I don't understand. Is this the way you are encouraging athletes?"" her father added.""We applied for the award but have heard nothing from the committee. Why are parents encouraging their kids to play; they should push them to become IRS officers in government,"" he said.",https://raorsingh.atlassian.net/wiki/rest/api/content/131085
9,2024-12-25 Meeting notes,"Pushpa 2 collection details:'Pushpa 2' has created history as it has crossed the record of Prabhas starrer 'Baahubali 2' which is the highest grossing Indian film. The collection of that was Rs 1040 crore. And now the collection of 'Pushpa 2' is higher and the film is still continuing at the box office. While Pushpa 2 and Allu Arjun may have surrounded themselves amidst the stampede controversy, there certainly aint no stopping to their movie.Day 0 ₹ 10.65 CrDay 1 ₹ 164.25 CrDay 2 ₹ 93.8 Cr .Day 3 ₹ 119.25 CrDay 4 ₹ 141.05 CrDay 5 ₹ 64.45 Cr Story: Pushpa 2: The Rule picks up from the dramatic finale of the first instalment, plunging audiences back into the gritty, high-stakes world of Pushpa Raj (Allu Arjun). This sequel raises the stakes, pitting Pushpa against Banwar Singh Shekhawat (Fahadh Faasil) and other formidable adversaries, while exploring his personal dilemmas more deeply. The overarching question—can Pushpa outsmart his opponents, or is there a twist in the tale?Review: Director Sukumar’s brilliance shines through in Pushpa 2: The Rule. He masterfully balances a mass entertainer with a film rich in social commentary, weaving layers of emotion, action, and intrigue into a compelling cinematic experience. Despite the extensive runtime of 3 hours and 20 minutes, the film keeps its audience riveted with a mix of high-octane sequences, character-driven moments, and a poignant emotional arc.Sukumar doesn’t just focus on the grandeur of action; he incorporates subtle humour through the quirks and mannerisms of the characters, whether it’s Pushpa Raj, Banwar Singh Shekhawat, or the supporting cast. Each character has a distinct identity that enriches the story. Even when the film seems to linger towards the end, the emotional payoff in the climax redeems it, providing satisfying closure to Pushpa’s internal and external conflicts.",https://raorsingh.atlassian.net/wiki/rest/api/content/262146
